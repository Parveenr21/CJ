	/*
	 * Overriding is a concept in Inheritance which happens to non static methods when 2 methods are DITTO same and belong to parent
	 * and child class
	 * 
	 * if these two methods are same but differs in return type then it would be compilation error 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * AS at the time of INHERITANCE both non static  and static DM and  Member functions are passed to child class.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * and child gets all the members and methods of parent class be it static or non static.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * so for non static methods we have OVERRIDING
	 * 
	 * for static ditto same methods we have METHOD HIDING
	 * 
	 * for non static DM we have DATA HIDING
	 * 
	 * 
	 * OVERLOADING happens in same class method with same name but diff in parameters
	 * 
	 * data shadowing is superseeding local variable over class varaiables when both local and class variable name are same.
	 *
