	 * It is creation of a new objects using some fuctionality/ behaviour from existing class
	 * 
	 * It includes both Data Members and Methods passing to child class unlike overriding where only non static methods get overridden
	 * 
	 * ACTAULLY we can call both PARENT static methods and DM also by child clas objects BECAUSE in INHERTIANCE.. or simply
	 *
	 *extending the class we get both STATIC and non static methods as well as DM of PARENT CLASS
	 * 
	 *  
	 * 
	 * the most important thing here is REUSABILITY.. both the parent and child classes use this functionality
	 * 
	 * alternative to INHERITANCE is association
	 * 
	 * it is of 4 type 
	 * SINGLE, MULTILEVEL,MULTIPLE AND HYBRID
	 * 
	 * JAva does not support multiple inheritance
	 * Multiple inheritance can create ambiguity.like 2 class with same name method and DM .. if extended by a class
	 * then it would be ambiguity.
	 * 
	 * it means one class can extends only one class and not more than that.. although class can implements more than one interfaces
	 * and one Interface can extends many interfaces.
	 *

	/*
	 * Once we do inheritance ..by EXTENDS... all DM and methods are copied to child class from parent class
	 * and no PARENT object is created if we create child object.. only constructor of parent class is called.
