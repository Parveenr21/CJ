Every exception object should be child of throwable
which by default is child of object class


Throwable has 2 childrens

ERROR
EXCEPTION


We never bother about ERROR as we can not handle those.. like thread death, JVM terminated

WE care about EXCEPTIONS:--

here we have 2 childrens of EXCEPTION

RUN TIME EXCEPTIONS:--These are UNCHECKED exceptions and comes at run-time generally beacuse of user data
or settings.. compiler does not force your to handle this.


OTHER EXCEPTIONS:--These are CHECKED exception and compiler forces you to put a handler here.
