Static inner class can access only static VARIABLES of Outer inner class by its methods
NonStaic inner class can access both  static and non static VARIABLES of Outer class,

static inner class can have its both static and non static members
inner class can only have non static members.

and override specific methods.
//This let us stop making a subclass for just one overridden method.


We can simply instantiate anonymous inner class without making a separate class.
The classical example of anonymous class is initializing an anonymous class for Runnable interface:
