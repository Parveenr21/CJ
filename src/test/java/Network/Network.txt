Networking is when two computers or programs communicate over network. It could be on a same machine 2 programs are communicating but
they must be using N/W communication.

To establish a communication ..the SENDER must know the address the RECEIVER.

ITs IP address where sender has to send the data ..now at DESTINATION IP address the intended message is received..but there are several 
applicatin that are listening to request ..so how come DESTINATION or receiver know that for which applicaion or service this message 
has come..so .. we have a PORT number..


SENDER needs IP addres and PORT no. to send the message to RECEIVER.


Now its sender wish which APPLICATION layer protocol it has to use..

so to establish a communication sender needs  

1. APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL
2. IP ADDRESS OR HOSTNAME
3. PORT NUMBER

IPv4 -- 4bytes , IPv6 6 bytes

Port Number 2 bytes .  means 1- 65****

 1 till 1023 port numbers are reserved for system or daemon processes.
we can run server or services at only  port number after 1023.

A SERVER RUUNING AT PORT 8080 MEANS..this does not mean that process is running at 8080.. process does not run at port..
It means ..it is listening at 8080.. or more precisely..It will accept any communication which is received at port 8080.

now at client side. a program which is sending data over N/W .. always get new ports..

as there could be many client or same client sending request to a server..

so each client request gets new port number every time..

so as we have limited number of ports available..
so obviously we can send this limited no. of request to server from a client..

or local machine or OS will invalidate the ports request and free the port in FIFO order..





SOCKET:--- 

To have a communication established between 2 parties or programs

A party can send a request or receive it.
If both party are communicating with each other..then its peer to peer..
It could be n no. of parties communication in full duplex ways.
Client server is little modified ways..
when A party sends request to get some info while party B only serves the request..then it is called client server relationship.


Socket is party A or B.
It is an end point of communication. 

A socket means end point with 3 info.(APP PROTOCOL name + PORT NUMBER + IP ADDRESS)
so we have client socket and server socket.

so to create 

a server socket or server program ..we need to create instance of SERVERSOCKET class and it accepts a parameter INT
which is port number..on which this socket will be listening.


a client socket or client program ..create instance of SOCKET class which will accept two args. string IP address (server IP)
 and INT which is port number to which it has to send the request.
 
 
Now as we create client socket ..
//Socket sc = new Socket("localhost", 1254);

this return a reference of client socket in sc and also pass this reference on N/W to server program too.

where it is catched by

//ServerSocket ss = new ServerSocket(1254); It create server socket and It blocks the port...

//socket sc=s.accept(); this waits for client socket reference to come ..

and once It gets the clinet request..it also get the clinet socket reference and now we can access any thing of client.

Its responisibility of Transport layer to identify the destination over N/W and whatever ways..means either TCP/UDP way

and IP address+protocol+portnumber is given to transport layer by applicaion layer.


now TCP:-- Its connection orieneted.. to establish comm. in tcp ways..a dedicated conn is required b/w clinet and server..
			like what we are doing in our programs.. It works on ack basis.
			
UDP: ---  its user datagram protocol.. unreliable..no dedicated conn is required.. here the packet ordering of sending can be 
			different than receiving ordering..here 5-10% error is there in any communication.
			   
			   
			   
			   UDP way communication programming can also be done..
